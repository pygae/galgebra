This package was originally written by Alan Bromborsky.

pygae/galgebra is a community fork, maintained by [Pythonic Geometric Algebra Enthusiasts](https://github.com/pygae).

Note that in the doc directory there is BookGA.pdf which is a collection of notes on 
Geometric Algebra and Calculus based of "Geometric Algebra for Physicists" by Doran and 
Lasenby and on some papers by Lasenby and Hestenes.

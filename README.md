[brombo/galgebra](https://github.com/brombo/galgebra) was originally written by Alan Bromborsky, but is no longer actively maintained.

[pygae/galgebra](https://github.com/pygae/galgebra) is a community fork, maintained by [Pythonic Geometric Algebra Enthusiasts](https://github.com/pygae).

The fork supports Python 3, increases test coverage, set up CI and linters, maintains releases to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/galgebra/#history), improves [docs](http://galgebra.readthedocs.io) and has many bug fixes.

Features
--------------------

### Geometric Algebra

- Basic Geometic Algebra Operations
  - Sum Difference
  - Geometric Product
  - Outer and Inner Products
  - Left and Right Contractions
  - Reverse, Dual, Exponential
  - Commutator

### Geometric Calculus

- Geometric Derivative
- Submanifolds
- Linear Transformations
- Differential Operators

The various derivatives of a multivector function is accomplished by multiplying the gradient operator vector with the function:

Tip: an example for getting `grad` and `rgrad`:

```python
(ex, ey, ez, grad, rgrad) = 
  MV.setup('e*x|y|z', metric='[1,1,1]', coords=symbols('x y z'))
```

### Printing

- Enhanced Console Printing
- Latex Printing
  - out-of-the-box support for Jupyter Notebook
  - PDF generation and croping support if you have `pdflatex`/`pdfcrop` installed

Getting Started
---------------------

After installing GAlgebra (see section [Installing GAlgebra](#installing-galgebra) below), in a Jupyter Notebook:

```python
from sympy import symbols
from galgebra.ga import Ga

from galgebra.printer import Format
Format(Fmode = False, Dmode = True)

st4coords = (t,x,y,z) = symbols('t x y z', real=True)
st4 = Ga('e_t e_x e_y e_z',
         g=[1,-1,-1,-1],
         coords=st4coords)

M = st4.mv('M','mv',f = True)

M.grade(3).Fmt(3,r'\langle \mathbf{M} \rangle _3')
```

You will see:

For detailed documentation and more examples, please check out https://galgebra.readthedocs.io/ .

**NOTE:** If you are coming from [sympy.galgebra](https://docs.sympy.org/0.7.6.1/modules/galgebra/) or [brombo/galgebra](https://github.com/brombo/galgebra), please check out section [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) below.

Installing GAlgebra
---------------------

### Prerequisites

- Works on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7 or 3
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) (will be automatically installed by `pip`)

### Installing GAlgebra From PyPI (Recommended for users)

```bash
pip install galgebra
```

Then you are all set!

### Installing GAlgebra From Source (Recommended for developers)

To install from the latest source code of GAlgebra:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pygae/galgebra.git
cd galgebra
pip install -e .
```

Note that the optional `-e` argument is used here for a developer install so modifying the source will take effect immediately without the need of reinstallation.

### Running tests to verify the installation

Run from the root of the repository:

```bash
python setup.py test
```

Or, preferably:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest test
```

Migration Guide
----------------

### Migrating from [sympy.galgebra](https://docs.sympy.org/0.7.6.1/modules/galgebra/)

GAlgebra is no longer part of SymPy since 1.0.0, if you have an import like this in your source:

```python
from sympy.galgebra.ga import *
```

Simply remove the `sympy.` prefix before `galgebra` then you are good to go:

```python
from galgebra.ga import *
```

### Migrating from [brombo/galgebra](https://github.com/brombo/galgebra)

The `setgapth.py` way to install is now deprecated by `pip install galgebra` and all modules in GAlgebra should be imported from `galgebra`, for example:

```python
from galgebra.printer import Format, Eprint, Get_Program, latex, GaPrinter
from galgebra.ga import Ga, one, zero
from galgebra.mv import Mv, Nga
# for backward compatibility
from galgebra.mv import MV, ONE, ZERO, HALF
from galgebra import ga
from galgebra import utils
```

Resources
------------

Note that in the doc directory there is BookGA.pdf which is a collection of notes on 
Geometric Algebra and Calculus based of "Geometric Algebra for Physicists" by Doran and 
Lasenby and on some papers by Lasenby and Hestenes.

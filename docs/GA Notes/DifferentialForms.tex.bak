\section{Differential Forms in Geometric Calculus}
\subsection{Inner Products of Subspaces}\label{sect5_6_1}
Start by considering products of the form where $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ are $r$-grade blades
\be
 A^{\R}_{r}\cdot B_{r} = \paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{b_{1}\W\dots\W b_{r}}
\ee
Both $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ define $r$-dimensional subspaces of the vector space via the equations $x\W A_{r} = 0$ and $x\W B_{r} = 0$.  
We show that if $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ do not 
define the same subspace then $A^{\R}_{r}\cdot B_{r} = 0$. Assume that they do not define the same subspaces, but
that the intersection of the subspaces has dimension $s<r$ so that one can have an orthogonal basis for $A_{r}$ of
$\Set{e_{1},\dots,e_{s},e_{s+1},\dots,e_{r}}$ and an orthogonal basis for $B_{r}$ of $\Set{e_{1},\dots,e_{s},e'_{s+1},\dots,e'_{r}}$. 
Then the geometric product of $A^{\R}_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ is
\begin{align}
 A^{\R}_{r}B_{r} &= \alpha e_{r}\dots e_{s+1}e_{s}\dots e_{1}\beta e_{1}\dots e_{s}e'_{s+1}\dots e'_{r} \nonumber \\
            &= \paren{\alpha\beta e_{1}^{2}\dots e_{s}^{2}}e_{s+1}\dots e_{1}e'_{s+1}\dots e'_{r}
\end{align}
where the quantity in parenthesis is a scalar and the other factors a blade of grade $2\paren{r-s}$. Thus 
\be\label{eq5_145}
	A^{\R}_{r}\cdot B_{r} = \braket{A^{\R}_{r}B_{r}} = 0.
\ee
If $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ define the same $r$-dimensional subspace let $\Set{e_{1},\dots, e_{r}}$ be an orthogonal basis for the subspace and
expand $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ in terms of the orthogonal basis vectors and reciprocal orthogonal basis vectors respectively -
\be\label{eq5_141}
	a_{i} = \paren{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}e_{j}
\ee
and 
\be\label{eq5_142}
	b_{i} = \paren{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}e^{j}
\ee
Let the matrices of the coefficients in equations~\ref{eq5_141} and \ref{eq5_142} be denoted by $\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}$ and 
$\Mat{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}$.  Then we can expand $A_{r}$ and $B_{r}$ as
\be
	A_{r} = \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}}e_{1}\dots e_{r}
\ee
and
\be
	B_{r} = \det\paren{\Mat{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}}e^{1}\dots e^{r}
\ee
and (since the determinant of a matrix and determinant of the transpose of matrix are equal)
\begin{align}
A^{\R}_{r}\cdot B_{r} &= \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}}\det\paren{\Mat{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}}\braket{e_{r}\dots e_{1}e^{1}\dots e^{r}} \nonumber \\
                      &= \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}}\det\paren{\Mat{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}} \nonumber \\
                      &= \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}}\det\paren{\Mat{b_{i}\cdot e_{j}}^{T}} \nonumber \\
                      &= \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot e^{j}}}\det\paren{\Mat{b_{j}\cdot e_{i}}} \nonumber \\
                      &= \det\paren{\Mat{\paren{a_{i}\cdot e^{k}}\paren{b_{j}\cdot e_{k}}}}
\end{align}
But 
\begin{align}
 a_{i}\cdot b_{j} &= \paren{a_{i}\cdot e^{k}}e_{k}\cdot\paren{b_{j}\cdot e_{l}}e^{l} \nonumber \\
                  &= \paren{a_{i}\cdot e^{k}}\paren{b_{j}\cdot e_{l}}\delta^{l}_{k} \nonumber \\
                  &= \paren{a_{i}\cdot e^{k}}\paren{b_{j}\cdot e_{k}}
\end{align}
So that
\be
A^{\R}_{r}\cdot B_{r} = \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot b_{j}}}.
\ee
From our derivations we see that if $A_{r}$ is a general $r$-grade multivector (not a blade) we can always find a $r$-grade blade such that
\be
	A^{\R}_{r}\cdot\paren{b_{1}\W\dots\W b_{r}} = \paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{b_{1}\W\dots\W b_{r}}.
\ee
Now consider the relation between the basis $\Set{a_{1},\dots, a_{n}}$ and the reciprocal basis $\Set{a^{1},\dots, a^{n}}$ for an $n$-dimensional vector space where 
in equation~\ref{eq5_149} $r \le n$ and $1 \le i_{l},j_{m} \le n$
\be\label{eq5_149}
	\paren{a_{i_{1}}\W\dots\W a_{i_{r}}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{a^{j_{1}}\W\dots\W a^{j_{r}}} = \det\paren{\Mat{a_{i_{l}}\cdot a^{j_{m}}}} = \det\paren{\Mat{\delta_{i_{l}}^{j_{m}}}}
\ee
where $i_{1}<i_{2}<\dots<i_{r}$ and  $j_{1}<j_{2}<\dots<j_{r}$.  Equation~\ref{eq5_149} is zero unless $i_{l}=j_{l}$ for all $1\le l \le r$ so that
\be
    \paren{a_{i_{1}}\W\dots\W a_{i_{r}}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{a^{j_{1}}\W\dots\W a^{j_{r}}} = \delta_{i_{1}}^{j_{1}}\delta_{i_{2}}^{j_{2}}\dots\delta_{i_{r}}^{j_{r}}.
\ee
since if the index ordering condition is satisfied for the $i_{l}$'s and the $j_{m}$'s and there is an index, $l$, such that $i_{l} \ne j_{l}$ then the two blades do not
define the same subspace and the inner product is zero.  The square of a blade is given by
\begin{align}
	\paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}}^{2} &= \paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}}\cdot\paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}} \\
	                               &= \paren{-1}^{\frac{r(r-1)}{2}}\paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}} \\
	                               &= \paren{-1}^{\frac{r(r-1)}{2}}\f{\det}{\Mat{a_{i}\cdot a_{j}}} \label{eq5_158}\\
	                               &= \paren{-1}^{\frac{r(r-1)}{2}}a_{1}^{2}\dots a_{r}^{2} \mbox{ if the $a_{i}$'s are orthogonal}.
\end{align}

\subsection{Alternating Forms}
If $V$ is a vector space then an $r$-rank tensor is a multilinear map
\be
	\f{T_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}:\bigotimes\limits_{i=1}^{r}V\rightarrow\mathcal{R}
\ee
where ($\otimes$ is the cartesian product of vector spaces)
\be
	\bigotimes\limits_{i=1}^{r}V = \underbrace{V\otimes\dots\otimes V}_{\mbox{$r$ times}}
\ee
so that if $v_{i}\in V$ the tuple $\paren{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}\in \bigotimes\limits_{i=1}^{r}V$.

The sum of two $r$-rank tensors is the $r$-rank tensor defined by
\be
	\f{\paren{A_{r}+B_{r}}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}} \equiv \f{A_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}+\f{B_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}.
\ee
The tensor product of rank $r$ and $s$ tensors is a rank $r+s$ tensor defined by
\be
	\f{\paren{A_{r}\otimes B_{s}}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r+s}} \equiv \f{A_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}\f{B_{s}}{v_{r+1},\dots,v_{r+s}}.
\ee
An $r$-form (when we say something is a form from now on we mean alternating form) is an $r$-rank tensor with the property (no summation in this case)
\be
\f{\alpha_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}} = \epsilon^{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}_{1\dots r}\f{\alpha_{r}}{v_{i_{1}},\dots,v_{i_{r}}}
\ee
where $\epsilon^{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}_{1\dots r}$ is the mixed rank permutation symbol.  We can always construct an $r$-form from an $r$-rank tensor via 
\be
	\f{\alpha_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}} = \f{\epsilon}{A_{r}} \equiv \sum_{i_{1},\dots,i_{r}}\epsilon_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}^{1\dots r}\f{A_{r}}{v_{i_{1}},\dots,v_{i_{r}}}
\ee
In the geometric algebra a simple representation of an alternating $r$-form is
\be
	\f{\alpha_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}} = A^{\R}_{r}\cdot\paren{v_{1}\W\dots\W v_{r}}
\ee
where $A_{r}$ is a grade-$r$ multivector.  Since the grade of $A_{r}$ and the grade of $\paren{v_{1}\W\dots\W v_{r}}$ are the same the 
inner product results in a scalar and also since $\paren{v_{1}\W\dots\W v_{r}}$ is a blade it alternates sign upon exchange of adjacent
vectors.

The basic operations of the ``Algebra of Forms'' inherit the sum and cartesian product operations from tensor since they are tensors.  However, 
in order to construct an algebra of forms we need a product of two forms that results in a form.  The tensor product of two alternating forms is
not an alternating form, but since we know how to convert a tensor to a form we define the exterior product of an $r$-form and $s$-form to be 
the $r+s$ form
\be\label{eq5_158}
	\alpha_{r}\Wbld \beta_{s} \equiv \f{\epsilon}{\alpha_{r}\otimes\beta_{s}}
\ee
as an example
\be
	\f{\alpha_{1}}{v_{1}}\Wbld\f{\beta_{1}}{v_{2}} = \f{\alpha_{1}}{v_{1}}\f{\beta_{1}}{v_{2}}-\f{\alpha_{1}}{v_{2}}\f{\beta_{1}}{v_{1}}
\ee
so that
\be
\f{\alpha_{r}}{v_{1},\dots,v_{r}}\Wbld\f{\beta_{s}}{v_{r+1},\dots,v_{r+s}} = \paren{A_{r}\W B_{s}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{v_{1}\W\dots\W v_{r+s}}
\ee
and
\be
	\alpha_{r}\Wbld\beta_{s} = \paren{-1}^{rs}\beta_{s}\Wbld\alpha_{r}
\ee
The interior product of an $r$ and $s$-form is defined by ($r > s$) an $r-s$ form (note that we are distinguishing the inner, $\cdotbld$, and
exterior, $\Wbld$, products for forms from the geometric algebra products by using boldface symbols)
\be
\beta_{s}\cdotbld\alpha_{r} \equiv \paren{B_{s}\cdot A_{r}}^{\R}\cdot\paren{v_{s+1}\W\dots\W v_{r}}
\ee
A $r$-form is simple if $A_{r}$ is a blade ($A_{r} = a_{1}\W\dots\W a_{r}$).

\subsection{Dual of a Vector Space}
Let $V$ be a $n$-dimensional vector space.  The set of all linear maps $f:V\rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ is denoted $V^{*}$ and is a vector space called the
dual space of $V$. $V^{*}$ is a $n$-dimensional vector space since for $f,g:V\rightarrow \mathcal{R}$, $x \in V$, $\alpha \in \mathcal{R}$ and we define
\begin{align}
	\f{\paren{f+g}}{x} \equiv \f{f}{x} +\f{g}{x} \\
	\f{\paren{\alpha f}}{x} \equiv \alpha\f{f}{x} \\
	\f{0}{x} \equiv 0
\end{align}
Then by the linearity of $\f{f}{x}$ and $\f{g}{x}$, $\f{\paren{f+g}}{x}$, $\f{\alpha f}{x}$, and $\f{0}{x}$ are also linear functions of $x$ and $V^{*}$ is
a vector space.

Let $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ be a basis for $V$ and define $\sigma^{i} \in V^{*}$ by
\be
	\f{\sigma^{i}}{\mathbf{e}_{j}} = \delta_{j}^{i}
\ee
so that if $x = x^{i}\mathbf{e}_{i} \in V$ then
\be
	\f{\sigma^{i}}{x} =  \f{\sigma^{i}}{x^{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}} = x^{i} 
\ee
so that for any $f \in V^{*}$
\be
	\f{f}{x} = \f{f}{x^{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}} = x^{i}\f{f}{\mathbf{e}_{i}}
\ee
Now assume that
\begin{align}
	0 &= a_{i}\f{\sigma^{i}}{\mathbf{e}_{j}} \\
	  &= a_{i}\delta_{j}^{i} \\
	  &= a_{j} 
\end{align}
so the $\sigma^{i}$ are linearly independent. Now assume $f \in V^{*}$.  Then
\begin{align}
	\f{f}{x} &= \f{f}{x^{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}} \\
	         &= x^{i}\f{f}{\mathbf{e}_{i}} \\
	         &= \f{f}{\mathbf{e}_{i}}\f{\sigma^{i}}{x} \\
	         &= \f{\paren{\f{f}{\mathbf{e}_{i}}\sigma^{i}}}{x}
\end{align}
Thus
\be
	f = \f{f}{\mathbf{e}_{i}}\sigma^{i}
\ee
and the $\sigma^{i}$ form a basis for $V^{*}$.  If the $\mathbf{e}_{i}$ form an 
orthonormal basis for $V$ (remember that orthonomal implies orthogonal and orthogonal
implies that a dot product is defined since the dot product is used to define orthogonal) then
\be
	\f{\sigma^{i}}{x} = \mathbf{e}_{i}\cdot x.
\ee
Since for 1-forms, $\alpha:V\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$, we have $\alpha\in V^{*}$.  The most
general 1-form can be written
\be
	\f{\alpha}{v} = \alpha_{i}\f{\sigma^{i}}{v}.
\ee
If $\alpha$ is a 2-form, $\f{\alpha}{v_{1},v_{2}}$, the bases are $\sigma^{i}\Wbld\sigma^{j}$, and
the most general 2-form is written as
\be
	\f{\alpha}{v_{1},v_{2}} = \sum_{i<j}\alpha_{ij}\f{\sigma^{i}}{v_{1}}\Wbld\f{\sigma^{j}}{v_{2}}	
\ee
since $\sigma^{i}\Wbld\sigma^{i}=0$ and $\sigma^{i}\Wbld\sigma^{j}=-\sigma^{i}\Wbld\sigma^{j}$ from
the definition in equation~\ref{eq5_158}.

\subsection{Standard Definition of a Manifold}
Let $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ be any set\footnote{This section is based upon sections 1.2 and 2.1 in 
``The Geometry of Physics, An Introduction (Second Edition),'' by T. Frankel} that has 
a covering of subsets, $\mathcal{M}^{n} = U\cup V\cup\dots$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each subset $U$ there is a one to one mapping $\phi_{U}:U\rightarrow\mathcal{R}^{n}$ where $\f{\phi_{U}}{U}$ is an 
	open subset of $\mathcal{R}^{n}$.
	\item Each $\f{\phi_{U}}{U\cap V}$ is an open subset of $\mathcal{R}^{n}$.
	\item The overlap maps
		\be
			f_{UV}= \phi_{V}\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}: \f{\phi_{U}}{U\cap V}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}^{n}
		\ee
	or equivalently the compound maps
		\be
			\f{\phi_{U}}{U\cap V}\stackrel{\phi_{U}^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{M}^{n}\stackrel{\phi_{V}}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{R}^{n}
		\ee
	are differentiable.
	\item Take a maximal atlas of coordinate patches $\Set{(U,\phi_{U}),(V,\phi_{V}),\dots}$ and define a topology for $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ by defining
	that a subset $W\subset \mathcal{M}^{n}$ is open if for any $p \in W$ there is a $(U,\phi_{U})$ such that $p\in U\subset W$.
\end{enumerate}
If the resulting topology for $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ is Hausdorff and has a countable base we say $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional differentiable manifold 
(look it up since I don't know what it means\footnote{G. Simmons,{\em Topology and Modern Analysis}, McGraw-Hill,1963}).

Figure~\ref{fig5_3} (page 94) shows the relationships between the Manifold and the coordinate patch mappings.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.75}{\includegraphics{manifolddef_crop.pdf}}
\caption{Fundamental Manifold Mappings.}\label{fig5_3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

If $f:\mathcal{M}^{n}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$ is a real valued function on the manifold $\mathcal{M}^{n}$ it is differentiable if $f_{U} = f\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}$
is differentiable with respect to the coordinates $\Set{x^{1}_{U},\dots, x^{n}_{U}}$ for any coordinate patch $(U,\phi_{U})$.  The real scalars 
$\Set{x^{1}_{U},\dots, x^{n}_{U}}$
(denoted by the tuple $x=\paren{x^{1}_{U},\dots,x^{n}_{U}}$) form a coordinate system for $\f{\phi_{U}}{U} \subset \mathcal{R}^{n}$.  In the future we shall simply
say that $f$ is differentiable if $f_{U}$ is differentiable.  Likewise we will shall usually omit the process of replacing $f$ by its composition 
$f\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}$, thinking of $f$ as directly expressible as a function $\f{f}{x} = \f{f}{x^{1}_{U},\dots,x^{n}_{U}}$ of any local coordinates.

Now let $p \in U\cap V \subset \mathcal{M}^{n}$ and 
\be
	x_{U} = \paren{x_{U}^{1},\dots,x_{U}^{n}} = \f{\phi_{U}}{p}\mbox{ and }x_{V} = \paren{x_{V}^{1},\dots,x_{V}^{n}} = \f{\phi_{V}}{p}. \nonumber
\ee
Then
\be
	x_{U} = \f{\phi_{U}\circ\phi_{V}^{-1}}{x_{V}}=\f{x_{U}}{x_{V}}\mbox{ and } x_{V} = \f{\phi_{V}\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}}{x_{U}}=\f{x_{V}}{x_{U}}. \nonumber
\ee
Let $X_{U} = \paren{X_{U}^{1},\dots,X_{U}^{n}}$ and consider the linear approximation to $\f{\phi_{V}\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}}{x_{U}+hX_{U}}$ where $h$ is a 
small number. Then in the linear approximation
\be
	\f{\phi_{V}\circ\phi_{U}^{-1}}{x_{U}+hX_{U}} = \f{x_{V}}{x_{U}}+h\mat{\pdiff{x_{V}^{i}}{x_{U}^{j}}}X_{U}^{T} = x_{V}+hX_{V}
\ee
so that
\be\label{eq5_161}
	X_{V}^{i} = \pdiff{x_{V}^{i}}{x_{U}^{j}}X_{U}^{j}
\ee
where $\mat{\pdiff{x_{V}^{i}}{x_{U}^{j}}}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation from one coordinate patch to another and $X_{U}^{T}$ is the 
transpose (colume vector) of the tuple $X_{U}$ (row vector).  
\subsection{Tangent Space}
Now consider the case of a vector manifold in Euclidian space.  The definition of the tangent vector generalizes the concept of the directional derivative
in $\mathcal{R}^{n}$. if $X_{p}$ is a vector at point $p \in \mathcal{R}^{n}$ and $f:\mathcal{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$ is a $C^{\infty}$ function in
the neighborhood of $p$ then define
\be
	\f{X_{p}}{f} \equiv X_{p}\cdot\Eval{\nabla f}{p}.
\ee
If $f$ and $g$ are $C^{\infty}$ and $\alpha,\beta \in \mathcal{R}$ we have (from the properties of $\cdot$ and $\nabla$)
\begin{align}
	\f{X_{p}}{\alpha f+\beta g} &= \alpha\f{X_{p}}{f} + \beta \f{X_{p}}{g} \\
	\f{X_{p}}{fg} &= \f{f}{p}\f{X_{p}}{g} + \f{g}{p}\f{X_{p}}{f}
\end{align}
Let $\f{C^{\infty}}{p}$ denote the set of real functions that are $C^{\infty}$ on some neighborhood of $p \in \mathcal{M}^{n}$. The generalization 
of the tangent vector to an abstract manifold at a point $p \in \mathcal{M}^{n}$ is defined as a real valued function $X_{p}: \f{C^{\infty}}{p}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$
such that ($f,g \in \f{C^{\infty}}{p}$ and $\alpha \in \mathcal{R}$)
\begin{align} 
	\f{X_{p}}{f+g} &= \f{X_{p}}{f}+\f{X_{p}}{g} \label{eq5_187}\\
	\f{X_{p}}{\alpha f} &= \alpha\f{X_{p}}{f} \label{eq5_188}\\
	\f{X_{p}}{fg} &= \f{f}{p}\f{X_{p}}{g}+\f{g}{p}\f{X_{p}}{f}.\label{eq5_189}
\end{align}
A tangent vector is often called a derivation on $\f{C^{\infty}}{p}$.  For a given coordinate patch $\paren{U,\phi_{U}}$ we define the tangent space basis
vectors $\paren{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}_{p}$ by 
\be\label{eq5_190}
	\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}f \equiv \Eval{\pdiff{\paren{f\circ\phi^{-1}_{U}}}{x^{i}_{U}}}{\f{\phi_{U}}{p}}.
\ee
Since they are partial derivatives the $\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}$ trivially satisfy equations~\ref{eq5_187}, \ref{eq5_188}, and \ref{eq5_189}.  The
general tangent vector is then given by the scalar linear differential operator
\be
	X_{p} = X^{i}_{U}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}
\ee
Thus we require for $X_{p}$
\be
	\f{X_{p}}{f} = X^{i}_{U}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}f = X^{j}_{V}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}_{V}}}{p}f
\ee
for all $p \in U\cap V$.  Thus
\begin{align}
	X^{i}_{U}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}f &= X^{j}_{V}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}_{V}}}{p}f \\
	X^{i}_{U}\Pval{\pdiff{x^{k}_{V}}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{k}_{V}}}{p}f &= X^{j}_{V}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}_{V}}}{p}f
\end{align}
and
\be\label{eq5_195}
	X^{j}_{V} = X^{i}_{U}\Pval{\pdiff{x^{j}_{V}}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}
\ee
is the transformation law for the components, $X^{i}_{U}$, of the tangent vectors.

We have established an isomorphism between the tuple $\paren{X^{1}_{U},\dots,X^{n}_{U}}$ that transforms as in equation~\ref{eq5_161} and the scalar
linear operator $X_{p}$ so that
\be
	\paren{X^{1}_{U},\dots,X^{n}_{U}} \Leftrightarrow X^{i}_{U}\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{u}}
\ee
since 
\be
	X_{U}^{i}\pdiff{f}{x_{U}^{i}} = X_{V}^{j}\pdiff{f}{x_{V}^{i}},\:\:\forall\:f:\mathcal{M}^{n}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}
\ee
implies equation~\ref{eq5_161}.
A vector field on a manifold is then a tangent vector with coefficients, $\f{X^{i}}{p}$ that are functions of the position $p$ on the manifold 
so that ($x_{U} = \paren{x^{1}_{U},\dots,x^{n}_{U}}$) 
\be\label{eq5_205}
	\f{X}{p} = \f{X_{U}}{x_{U}} = \f{X^{i}_{U}}{x_{U}}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p} = \f{X^{i}_{U}}{x^{1}_{U},\dots,x^{n}_{U}}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}_{U}}}{p}
\ee
and the coefficients $\f{X^{i}_{U}}{x_{U}}$ transform under a change of basis according to equation~\ref{eq5_195}.

\subsection{Differential Forms and the Dual Space}

If $f:\mathcal{M}^{n}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$ we define the differential of $f$ at $p\in\mathcal{M}^{n}$, $df:\mathcal{M}^{n}_{p}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$
where $X_{p}\in\mathcal{M}^{n}_{p}$ as the linear functional
\be
	\f{df}{X} \equiv \f{X_{p}}{f}
\ee
so that in general case of $X$ being a vector field (we are supressing the the patch index $U$)
\be
	\f{df}{\f{X}{p}} = \f{df}{\f{X^{i}}{p}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}}}{p}} = \f{X^{i}}{p}\Eval{\pdiff{f}{x^{i}}}{p}.
\ee
If $\f{f}{p}=\f{x^{i}}{p}$ are the coordinate functions we have
\be
	\f{dx^{i}}{\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}}}{p}} = \Eval{\pdiff{x^{i}}{x^{j}}}{p} = \delta^{i}_{j}
\ee
and
\be
	\f{dx^{i}}{\f{X}{p}} = \f{dx^{i}}{\f{X^{j}}{p}\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}}}{p}} = \f{X^{j}}{p}\f{dx^{i}}{\Pval{\pdiff{}{x^{j}}}{p}} = \f{X^{i}}{p}.
\ee

Consider what this means in a vector manifold where the point $p$ on the manifold is a vector in the embedding vector space.  Then the coordinate
functions $\f{x^{i}}{p}$ can be inverted and the manifold defined by $\f{p}{x^{1},\dots,x^{n}}$.  Knowing the tuple $\paren{x^{1},\dots,x^{n}}$ lets
one calculate the vector $p$ on the manifold.  Then the basis tangent vectors are $e_{i} = \pdiff{p}{x^{i}}$ and the general tangent vector is
$X_{p}= X^{i}e_{i} = X^{i}\pdiff{p}{x^{i}}$.  Now let $\f{f}{p}=\f{f}{x^{1},\dots,x^{n}}:\mathcal{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathcal{R}$ be a function from
the manifold to the scalars and denote the directional derivative of $f$ as
\be
	\f{df}{X_{p}} = X\cdot\eval{\nabla f}{p} = X^{i}\eval{\pdiff{f}{x^{i}}}{p}
\ee
which is the same as equation~\ref{eq5_205} and the justification for defining the tangent vectors as the linear scalar differential operator 
$X_{p} = X^{i}\eval{\pdiff{}{x^{i}}}{p}$.
What is called the differential operator in the language of differential forms becomes the directional derivative on a vector manifold.

The $dx^{i}$ form a basis for the dual space $\mathcal{M}^{n*}_{p}$.  The most general element of $\mathcal{M}^{n*}_{p}$ can then be written as
\be
	\alpha = \alpha_{i}dx^{i}.
\ee
The linear functional $\alpha\in\mathcal{M}^{n*}_{p}$ is called a covariant vector, covector, or 1-form.  If $\alpha_{i}$ is a function of $p$ it is
called a covector field.

$\alpha$ is an $r$-form if
\be
	\alpha = \f{\alpha_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}}{p}dx^{i_{1}}\Wbld\dots\Wbld dx^{i_{r}}
\ee 
where $i_{1}<i_{2}<\dots<i_{r}$.  The exterior derivative of $\alpha$ is an $r+1$ form defined by
\be
	d\alpha \equiv \paren{\f{d\alpha_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}}{p}}\Wbld dx^{i_{1}}\Wbld\dots\Wbld dx^{i_{r}}.
\ee
For example if $\alpha = \alpha_{1}dx^{1}+\alpha_{2}dx^{2}+\alpha_{3}dx^{3}$ then the exterior derivative of the 1-form $\alpha$ is
\be
	d\alpha = \paren{\pdiff{\alpha_{2}}{x^{1}}-\pdiff{\alpha_{1}}{x^{2}}}dx^{1}\Wbld dx^{2}+
	          \paren{\pdiff{\alpha_{3}}{x^{1}}-\pdiff{\alpha_{1}}{x^{3}}}dx^{1}\Wbld dx^{3}+
	          \paren{\pdiff{\alpha_{3}}{x^{2}}-\pdiff{\alpha_{2}}{x^{3}}}dx^{2}\Wbld dx^{3}
\ee
and if $\alpha = \alpha_{12}dx^{1}\Wbld dx^{2}+\alpha_{13}dx^{1}\Wbld dx^{3}+\alpha_{23}dx^{2}\Wbld dx^{3}$ then the exterior derivative of
the 2-form $\alpha$ is
\be
	d\alpha = \paren{\pdiff{\alpha_{12}}{x^{1}}-\pdiff{\alpha_{13}}{x^{2}}+\pdiff{\alpha_{23}}{x^{3}}}dx^{1}\Wbld dx^{2}\Wbld dx^{3}.
\ee

\subsection{Connecting Differential Forms to Geometric Calculus}

If A is a grade one multivector the differential 1-form $\alpha$ can be written
\be
	\alpha = A\cdot\paren{dx}
\ee
where $A=A_{i}e^{i}$ and $dx=e_{j}dx^{j}$. Similarly if $d^{2}X$ is a directed measure over a 2-dimensional surface we have
\be
	d^{2}X = e_{m}\W e_{n}dx^{m}dx^{n}
\ee
so that (using equation~\ref{eq465})
\begin{align}
	\paren{e^{j}\W e^{i}}\cdot d^{2}X &= \paren{e^{j}\W e^{i}}\cdot\paren{e_{m}\W e_{n}dx^{m}dx^{n}} \nn \\
	                                  &= \paren{\paren{e^{j}\cdot e_{n}}\paren{e^{i}\cdot e_{m}}-\paren{e^{j}\cdot e_{m}}\paren{e^{i}\cdot e_{n}}}dx^{m}dx^{n} \nn \\
	                                  & = \paren{\delta^{j}_{n}\delta^{i}_{m}-\delta^{j}_{m}\delta^{i}_{n}}dx^{m}dx^{n} \nn \\
	                                  &= dx^{i}dx^{j}-dx^{j}dx^{i} \nn \\
	                                  &= dx^{i}\Wbld dx^{j}.
\end{align}
An arbitrary 2-form can be written as
\be
	\alpha = \alpha_{ij}\paren{dx^{i}dx^{j}-dx^{j}dx^{i}} = \alpha_{ij}dx^{i}\Wbld dx^{j} = A^{\R}_{2}\cdot d^{2}X
\ee
where $A_{2}=\alpha_{ij}e^{i}\W e^{j}$.  More generally an $r$-form $\alpha_{r}$ can be written as
\be
	\alpha_{r} = A^{\R}_{r}\cdot d^{r}X = A_{r}\cdot \paren{d^{r}X}^{\R}
\ee
where $A_{r} = \alpha_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}e^{i_{1}}\W\dots\W e^{i_{r}}$ and $d^{r}X=\paren{e_{i_{1}}\W\dots\W e_{i_{r}}}dx^{i_{1}}\dots dx^{i_{r}}$.
Since $D\W\paren{e^{i_{1}}\W\dots\W e^{i_{r}}} = 0$ by equation~\ref{eq5_125} the exterior dervative of an $r$-form is given by
\be\label{eq5_216}
	d\alpha_{r} = \paren{D\W A_{r}}\cdot \paren{d^{r+1}X}^{\R} = \paren{D\W A_{r}}^{\R}\cdot d^{r+1}X =
	              \paren{\dot{A}^{\R}_{r} \W \dot{D}}\cdot d^{r+1}X
\ee
(remember that $D^{\R}=D$ since $D$ is a vector operator) which can be seen by comparing the statement of Stokes' theorem in differential forms
\be
	\int_{\sigma_{r}}d\paren{\alpha_{r-1}} = \oint_{\partial\sigma_{r}}\alpha_{r-1}
\ee
where $\alpha_{r-1}$ is an ($r-1$)-form integrated over an open $r$-surface $\sigma_{r}$.  Using 
equation~\ref{eq5_216} we can write
\be
	\int_{\sigma_{r}}d\paren{\alpha_{r-1}} = \int_{\sigma_{r}}\paren{\dot{A}^{\R}_{r-1}\W \dot{D}}\cdot d^{r}X = 
	\oint_{\partial\sigma_{r}}\paren{A^{\R}_{r-1}}\cdot d^{r-1}S = \oint_{\partial\sigma_{r}}\alpha_{r-1},
\ee
but this is just a restatment of equation~\ref{eq5_137}.  The one other differential form operation of interest is
the Hodge dual denoted by $*$.  If $\alpha_{r}$ is an $r$-form the Hodge dual, $*\alpha_{r}$, is an ($n-r$)-form where
$n$ is the dimension of the manfold.  To define the Hodge dual first define the scalar function $\sqrt{\abs{g}}$ by
\be
	I = \bfrac{1}{\sqrt{\abs{g}}}\paren{e_{1}\W\dots\W e_{n}}
\ee
where $I$ is the normalized pseudoscalar so that $I^{2}=\pm 1$.  $g$ is also given by $g = \f{\det}{g_{ij}}$ where $g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor
for the manifold.  The Hodge dual for an $r$-form $\alpha_{r} = \alpha_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}dx^{i_{1}}\Wbld\dots\Wbld dx^{i_{r}}$ is defined by
\be
	*\alpha_{r} \equiv \bfrac{\sqrt{\abs{g}}}{r!\paren{m-r}!}\alpha_{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}\epsilon^{i_{1}\dots i_{r}}_{j_{r+1}\dots j_{n}}
	dx^{j_{r+1}}\Wbld\dots\Wbld dx^{j_{n}}.
\ee
If $A_{r}$ is the multivector equivalent to $\alpha_{r}$ then
\be\label{eq5_221}
	*A_{r} = \paren{I^{-1}A_{r}}^{\R} = \paren{I^{-1}\cdot A_{r}}^{\R}
\ee
and
\be\label{eq5_222}
	*\hspace{-3pt}*\hspace{-3pt}A_{r} = \paren{I^{-1}\paren{I^{-1}\cdot A_{r}}^{\R}}^{\R} = \paren{-1}^{r\paren{m-r}}A_{r}\paren{I^{\R}I}
\ee
where $I^{\R}I=\pm 1$ depending upon the signature and dimension of the manifold.  We will not prove equations~\ref{eq5_221} and \ref{eq5_222}
since our interest is only in describing the correspondence between geometric calculus and differential forms.  We will not be using
differential forms.
